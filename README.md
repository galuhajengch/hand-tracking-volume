# ðŸ–– Hand Tracking Volume Control

Ever wanted to control your computer volume like a Jedi? Well, now you can.  
This project uses real-time hand tracking to turn your fingers into a volume knob. No clicks, no keys â€” just âœ¨vibesâœ¨ and OpenCV magic.

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Tracks your hand in real-time using your webcam  
- Measures the distance between your thumb and index finger  
- Turns that distance into volume control  
- Shows visual feedback so you know whatâ€™s up

## ðŸ§  Built With
- `Python` (the OG for prototyping cool stuff)
- `OpenCV` (camera + vision = chefâ€™s kiss)
- `MediaPipe` (Googleâ€™s wizardry for hand tracking)
- `PyCaw` (lets you actually change the volume on Windows)

## ðŸ’» Setup (Super Easy, Promise)
Clone this bad boy and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking-volume.git
cd hand-tracking-volume
pip install -r requirements.txt
